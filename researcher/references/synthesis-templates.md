## Confidence Level Guidelines

**High confidence**: Multiple authoritative sources agree, recent information, directly applicable to our situation

**Medium confidence**: Good sources but some gaps, information is somewhat dated, or requires some extrapolation to our situation

**Low confidence**: Limited sources, conflicting information, significantly different context from our situation, or requires substantial assumptions
