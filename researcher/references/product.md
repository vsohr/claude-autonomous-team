# Product & Market Research Patterns

## Competitor Analysis

### Information Hierarchy

1. **Product itself** (sign up, use free tier, watch demos)
2. **Pricing pages** (reveals target customer and positioning)
3. **User reviews** (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, app stores)
4. **Job postings** (reveals tech stack, growth areas, challenges)
5. **Company blog/changelog** (product direction)
6. **Social mentions** (Twitter/X, Reddit, HN)

### Search Patterns

```
"{competitor} review {year}"
"{competitor} vs" (autocomplete reveals alternatives)
"{competitor} alternative"
"site:reddit.com {competitor} opinions"
"site:news.ycombinator.com {competitor}"
"{competitor} pricing" OR "{competitor} cost"
```

### What to Extract

- Target customer segment
- Core value proposition
- Pricing model and tiers
- Key differentiators claimed
- Common complaints (from reviews)
- Recent product changes (changelog)

## Market Landscape Research

### Mapping the Space

1. **Identify categories**: What do people call this space?
2. **Find market maps**: "{category} market map" or "{category} landscape"
3. **Analyst coverage**: Gartner, Forrester for enterprise; CB Insights for startups
4. **Funding data**: Crunchbase, PitchBook for investment signals

### Sizing Signals

- Competitor funding amounts and stages
- Job posting volumes across companies
- Conference/event existence and size
- Dedicated publications or newsletters

## User Research (Secondary)

### Finding Real User Feedback

```
"site:reddit.com r/{relevant_subreddit} {topic}"
"site:news.ycombinator.com Ask HN: {topic}"
"{product} honest review"
"{problem} how do you solve"
"switched from {product} to"
```

### Review Analysis

When reading reviews, extract:
- **Use case**: What job are they hiring the product for?
- **Praise patterns**: What do multiple reviewers love?
- **Complaint patterns**: What do multiple reviewers hate?
- **Workarounds**: What are people doing despite the product?
- **Switching triggers**: Why did they leave competitors?

### Bias Awareness

- Review platforms may have selection bias (unhappy users more vocal)
- Some reviews are incentivized or fake (look for detail and specificity)
- Power users have different needs than casual users
- B2B reviews often come from buyers, not daily users

## Feature Validation Research

### Demand Signals

```
"{feature} request" site:feedback.{competitor}.com
"{feature}" site:canny.io OR site:productboard.com
"wish {product} had {feature}"
"need {feature} for {use case}"
```

### Build vs Buy vs Partner

Questions to answer:
- Do competitors offer this as core feature?
- Are there point solutions that could integrate?
- What's the complexity to build?
- Is this a differentiator or table stakes?

## Pricing Research

### Competitive Pricing Intelligence

- Screenshot pricing pages (they change)
- Note what's included at each tier
- Identify usage-based vs seat-based models
- Look for enterprise "contact us" signals
- Check for published case studies with company sizes

### Pricing Positioning Signals

- Low price + feature parity = commoditization play
- High price + unique features = premium differentiation
- Usage-based = betting on expansion revenue
- Free tier exists = PLG motion, conversion funnel matters

## Technology Trends Research

### Signal Sources

- **Early signal**: Academic papers, HN discussions, niche blogs
- **Growing signal**: VC investment themes, job posting trends
- **Mainstream signal**: Enterprise adoption, Gartner recognition

### Hype vs Reality Check

Questions to cut through hype:
- Who is actually using this in production?
- What are the failure cases?
- What does this replace, and why would someone switch?
- What's the learning curve and adoption cost?

## Synthesis for Product Decisions

1. User demand evidence (or lack thereof)
2. Competitive landscape (who has it, how good)
3. Technical feasibility signals
4. Strategic fit assessment
5. Recommendation with confidence level

### For "How Should We Position?"

Structure findings as:
1. Current competitive positioning map
2. Underserved segments or angles
3. Messaging that resonates (from reviews)
